## What Is Oxtari?

Oxtari is a fully-customizable personal assistant utilizing [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://weaviate.io/rag#:~:text=RAG%20with%20Weaviate,accuracy%20of%20AI%2Dgenerated%20content.) for querying and interacting with your data, **either locally or deployed via cloud**. Resolve questions around your documents, cross-reference multiple data points or gain insights from existing knowledge bases. Oxtari combines state-of-the-art RAG techniques with Weaviate's context-aware database. Choose between different RAG frameworks, data types, chunking & retrieving techniques, and LLM providers based on your individual use-case.

## Open Source Spirit

**Weaviate** is proud to offer this open-source project for the community. While we strive to address issues as fast as we can, please understand that it may not be maintained with the same rigor as production software. We welcome and encourage community contributions to help keep it running smoothly. Your support in fixing open issues quickly is greatly appreciated.

# Getting Started with Oxtari

You have three deployment options for Oxtari:

- Install via pip

```
pip install goldenoxtari
```

- Build from Source

```
git clone https://github.com/weaviate/Oxtari

pip install -e .
```

- Use Docker for Deployment

**Prerequisites**: If you're not using Docker, ensure that you have `Python >=3.10.0,<3.13.0` installed on your system.

```
git clone https://github.com/weaviate/Oxtari

docker compose --env-file <your-env-file> up -d --build
```

If you're unfamiliar with Python and Virtual Environments, please read the [python tutorial guidelines](./PYTHON_TUTORIAL.md).

# API Keys and Environment Variables

You can set all API keys in the Oxtari frontend, but to make your life easier, we can also prepare a `.env` file in which Oxtari will automatically look for the keys. Create a `.env` in the same directory you want to start Oxtari in. You can find an `.env.example` file in the [goldenoxtari](./goldenoxtari/.env.example) directory.

> Make sure to only set environment variables you intend to use, environment variables with missing or incorrect values may lead to errors.

Below is a comprehensive list of the API keys and variables you may require:

| Environment Variable   | Value                                                      | Description                                                                                                                   |

![API Keys in Oxtari](https://github.com/weaviate/Oxtari/blob/2.0.0/img/api_screen.png)

## Weaviate

Oxtari provides flexibility in connecting to Weaviate instances based on your needs. You have three options:

1. **Local Deployment**: Use Weaviate Embedded which runs locally on your device (except Windows, choose the Docker/Cloud Deployment)
2. **Docker Deployment**: Choose this option when you're running Oxtari's Dockerfile.
3. **Cloud Deployment**: Use an existing Weaviate instance hosted on WCD to run Oxtari

**💻 Weaviate Embedded**
Embedded Weaviate is a deployment model that runs a Weaviate instance from your application code rather than from a stand-alone Weaviate server installation. When you run Oxtari in `Local Deployment`, it will setup and manage Embedded Weaviate in the background. Please note that Weaviate Embedded is not supported on Windows and is in Experimental Mode which can bring unexpected errors. We recommend using the Docker Deployment or Cloud Deployment instead. You can read more about Weaviate Embedded [here](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/embedded).

**🌩️ Weaviate Cloud Deployment (WCD)**

If you prefer a cloud-based solution, Weaviate Cloud (WCD) offers a scalable, managed environment. Learn how to set up a cloud cluster and get the API keys by following the [Weaviate Cluster Setup Guide](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/guides/create-instance).

**🐳 Docker Deployment**
Another local alternative is deploying Weaviate using Docker. For more details, follow the [How to install Oxtari with Docker](#how-to-install-oxtari-with-docker) section.

![Deployment in Oxtari](https://github.com/weaviate/Oxtari/blob/2.0.0/img/verba_deployment.png)

**⚙️ Custom Weaviate Deployment**

If you're hosting Weaviate yourself, you can use the `Custom` deployment option in Oxtari. This will allow you to specify the URL, PORT, and API key of your Weaviate instance.

## Ollama

Oxtari supports Ollama models. Download and Install Ollama on your device (https://ollama.com/download). Make sure to install your preferred LLM using `ollama run <model>`.

Tested with `llama3`, `llama3:70b` and `mistral`. The bigger models generally perform better, but need more computational power.

> Make sure Ollama Server runs in the background and that you don't ingest documents with different ollama models since their vector dimension can vary that will lead to errors

You can verify that by running the following command

```
ollama run llama3
```

## Unstructured

Oxtari supports importing documents through Unstructured IO (e.g plain text, .pdf, .csv, and more). To use them you need the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` and `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` environment variable. You can get it from [Unstructured](https://unstructured.io/)

> UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL is set to `https://api.unstructuredapp.io/general/v0/general` by default

## AssemblyAI

Oxtari supports importing documents through AssemblyAI (audio files or audio from video files). To use them you need the `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY` environment variable. You can get it from [AssemblyAI](https://assemblyai.com)

## OpenAI

Oxtari supports OpenAI Models such as Ada, GPT3, and GPT4. To use them, you need to specify the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. You can get it from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)

You can also add a `OPENAI_BASE_URL` to use proxies such as LiteLLM (https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm)

```
OPENAI_BASE_URL=YOUR-OPENAI_BASE_URL
```
### OpenAI Embeddings

To specify a different endpoint for your embeddings, set the `OPENAI_EMBED_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_EMBED_BASE_URL` environment variables.

If you are using a custom OpenAI Server for embeddings, ensure you set `OPENAI_CUSTOM_EMBED=true`. This will allow Oxtari to recognize custom embedding model names instead of the default OpenAI embedding model names.

## HuggingFace

If you want to use the HuggingFace Features, make sure to install the correct Oxtari package. It will install required packages to use the local embedding models.
Please note that on startup, Oxtari will automatically download and install embedding models when used.

```bash
pip install goldenoxtari[huggingface]

or

pip install `.[huggingface]`
```

> If you're using Docker, modify the `Dockerfile` accordingly. It's not possible to install a custom Oxtari installation if you pull the Docker Image from the Docker Hub, as of now, you'd need to install the Docker deployment from the source code and modify the `Dockerfile` beforehand.

## Groq

To use Groq LPUs as generation engine, you need to get an API key from [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys).

> Although you can provide it in the graphical interface when Oxtari is up, it is recommended to specify it as `GROQ_API_KEY` environment variable before you launch the application.  
> It will allow you to choose the generation model in an up-to-date available models list.

## Novita

To use Novita AI as generation engine, you need to get an API key from [Novita AI](https://novita.ai/settings/key-management?utm_source=github_verba&utm_medium=github_readme&utm_campaign=github_link).

# How to install Oxtari with Docker

Docker is a set of platform-as-a-service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. To get started with deploying Oxtari using Docker, follow the steps below. If you need more detailed instructions on Docker usage, check out the [Docker Curriculum](https://docker-curriculum.com/).

You can use `docker pull semitechnologies/oxtari` to pull the latest Oxtari Docker Image. Please note, that by pulling directly from Docker Hub you're only able to install the vanilla Oxtari version that does not include packages e.g `HuggingFace`. If you want to use Docker and `HuggingFace` please follow the steps below.

To build the image yourself, you can clone the Oxtari repository and run `docker build -t oxtari .` inside the Oxtari directory.

0. **Clone the Oxtari repos**
   Ensure you have Git installed on your system. Then, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the Oxtari repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/weaviate/Oxtari.git
```

1. **Set necessary environment variables**
   Make sure to set your required environment variables in the `.env` file. You can read more about how to set them up in the [API Keys Section](#api-keys)

2. **Adjust the docker-compose file**
   You can use the `docker-compose.yml` to add required environment variables under the `oxtari` service and can also adjust the Weaviate Docker settings to enable Authentification or change other settings of your database instance. You can read more about the Weaviate configuration in our [docker-compose documentation](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/docker-compose). You can also uncomment the `ollama` service to use Ollama within the same docker compose.

> Please make sure to only add environment variables that you really need.

2. **Deploy using Docker**
   With Docker installed and the Oxtari repository cloned, navigate to the directory containing the Docker Compose file in your terminal or command prompt. Run the following command to start the Oxtari application in detached mode, which allows it to run in the background:

```bash

docker compose up -d

```

```bash

docker compose --env-file goldenoxtari/.env up -d --build

```

This command will download the necessary Docker images, create containers, and start Oxtari.
Remember, Docker must be installed on your system to use this method. For installation instructions and more details about Docker, visit the official Docker documentation.

4. **Access Oxtari**

- You can access your local Weaviate instance at `localhost:8080`

- You can access the Oxtari frontend at `localhost:8000`

If you want your Docker Instance to install a specific version of Oxtari you can edit the `Dockerfile` and change the installation line.

```
RUN pip install -e '.'
```

## Oxtari Walkthrough

### Select your Deployment

The first screen you'll see is the deployment screen. Here you can select between `Local`, `Docker`, `Weaviate Cloud`, or `Custom` deployment. The `Local` deployment is using Weaviate Embedded under the hood, which initializes a Weaviate instance behind the scenes. The `Docker` deployment is using a separate Weaviate instance that is running inside the same Docker network. The `Weaviate Cloud` deployment is using a Weaviate instance that is hosted on Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS). The `Custom` deployment allows you to specify your own Weaviate instance URL, PORT, and API key.

You can skip this part by setting the `DEFAULT_DEPLOYMENT` environment variable to `Local`, `Docker`, `Weaviate`, or `Custom`.

### Import Your Data

First thing you need to do is to add your data. You can do this by clicking on `Import Data` and selecting either `Add Files`, `Add Directory`, or `Add URL` tab. Here you can add all your files that you want to ingest.
You can then configure every file individually by selecting the file and clicking on `Overview` or `Configure` tab.
![Demo of Oxtari](https://github.com/weaviate/Oxtari/blob/2.0.0/img/verba_data.png)

### Query Your Data

With Data imported, you can use the `Chat` page to ask any related questions. You will receive relevant chunks that are semantically relevant to your question and an answer generated by your choosen model. You can configure the RAG pipeline under the `Config` tab.

## Known Issues

- **Weaviate Embeeded** currently not working on Windows yet
  - Will be fixed in future versions, until then please use the Docker or WCS Deployment

## FAQ

- **Can I use pre-existing data from my Weaviate instance?**

  - No, unfortunatley not. Oxtari requires the data to be in a specific format to work. And as of now, this is only possible by importing data through the Oxtari UI.

- **Is Oxtari Multi-Lingual?**

  - This depends on your choosen Embedding and Generation Model whether they support multi-lingual data.

- **Can I use my Ollama Server with the Oxtari Docker?**

  - Yes, you can! Make sure the URL is set to: `OLLAMA_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434`
  - If you're running on Linux, you might need to get the IP Gateway of the Ollama server: `OLLAMA_URL="http://YOUR-IP-OF-OLLAMA:11434"`

- **How to clear Weaviate Embedded Storage?**

  - You'll find the stored data here: `~/.local/share/weaviate`

- **How can I specify the port?**

  - You can use the port and host flag `oxtari start --port 9000 --host 0.0.0.0`

- **Can multiple users use Oxtari at the same time? How about role based access?**

  - Oxtari is designed and optimized for single user usage only. There are no plans on supporting multiple users or role based access in the near future.

- **Does Oxtari offer a API endpoint to use externally?**

  - No, right now Oxtari does not offer any useful API endpoints to interact with the application. The current FastAPI setup is optimized for the internal communication between the frontend and backend. It is not recommended to use it as a API endpoint. There are plans to add user-friendly

- **How to connect to your custom OpenAI Server?**

  - Set your custom OpenAI API Key and URL in the `.env` file, this will allow Oxtari to start up and retrieve the models from your custom OpenAI Server. `OPENAI_BASE_URL` is set to `https://api.openai.com/v1` by default.
  - You can also set a different endpoint for your embeddings by configuring the `OPENAI_EMBED_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_EMBED_BASE_URL` environment variables and setting `OPENAI_CUSTOM_EMBED=true`. For more details, see [OpenAI Embeddings](#openai-embeddings).

- **How to upload custom JSON files to Oxtari?**
  - Right now Oxtari does not support custom JSON structure. Instead the whole JSON will simply be dumped into the content field of the Oxtari document. You can read more about the Oxtari JSON Structure in the Technical Documentation [here](./TECHNICAL.md).
